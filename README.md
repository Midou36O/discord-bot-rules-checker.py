# discord-bot-rules-checker
Written in python3 using discord.py, this bot proceeds to verify the specified channel id's hidden words (previously private and was used on a 7k server ~no i'm not flexing~)

**this bot is useful if :** 
  * you need an automated verification bot that checks hidden words in the server
  * you want to make people read the rules before joining
  * or make a "i agree" verification system
 
 Feel free to take the bot's code if you're interested, oh and it's compatible with heroku [thanks to this project](https://github.com/audieni/discord-py-heroku).
 
 And thanks to [@Pikalex04](https://github.com/Pikalex04) for helping me make the bot!
